<p>"This blog is my go-to resource whenever we plan a get together at our house. Last Diwali I whipped up this tandoori chicken kati rolls recipe and my mother couldn't believe that I made them myself! She went as far as asking me for the caterer! I told her that DesiMommyLife always saves the day when I am in an entertaining pinch! </br>

<p>"I always order tandoori chicken when we go to our favorite Indian restaurants but I never saw this on any menus so I decided to give it a shot. Mind you, I never cooked an Indian dish in my life, but this recipe included links and suggestions for where to find the ingredients and easy to follow steps all the way through. My girlfriend was amazed when I made these for her last Valentine's day, she made me promise to make these every year instead of going out for dinner! These tandoori chicken kati rolls are a game-changer for real."
